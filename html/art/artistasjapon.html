                <h2 class="titulo">Katsushika Hokusai</h2>
                <p>Master of Ukiyo-e (浮世絵), or the art of Japanese engravings between the 17th and 20th
                    centuries, Hokusai was one of Japan's most prestigious artists and certainly the most
                    international Japanese artist. His drawings, which arrived in Paris in the mid-19th century,
                    fascinated and influenced all the Impressionists, from Monet to Van Gogh.
                    But his influence does not end there: some say that without Hokusai, various artistic
                    disciplines such as modern woodcut, graphic design, comics, manga and even tattooing
                    would not be the same.
                    An artist of legendary humility, he always considered himself “a simple apprentice” and
                    signed his works with different names, such as “Shunro”, “Sori”, “Kako”, “Taito”,
                    “Gakyonjin”, “Iitsu” and “Manji”. A hard worker, he would get up early and paint until late
                    at night, drawing until the last day of his life. Despite being an old man, in his last days he
                    became more and more energetic and spontaneous. He enjoyed great prestige in the Japanese
                    artistic community and his prints reached the West, where young artists were able to capture
                    his obvious and original genius.

                <p>Yayoi Kusama (born March 22, 1929, Matsumoto, Japan) is a Japanese artist who is a selfdescribed
                    “obsessional artist,” known for her extensive use of polka dots and for her infinity
                    installations. She employed painting, sculpture, performance art, and installations in a variety
                    of styles, including Pop art and Minimalism.
                    By her own account, Kusama began painting as a child, at about the time she began
                    experiencing hallucinations that often involved fields of dots. Those hallucinations and the
                    theme of dots would continue to inform her art throughout her career. She had little formal
                    training, studying art only briefly (1948–49) at the Kyōto City Specialist School of Arts.
                    Family conflict and the desire to become an artist drove her to move in 1957 to the United
                    States, where she settled in New York City. Before leaving Japan, she destroyed many of her
                    early paintings.
                    Her early work in New York City included what she called “infinity net” paintings. Those
                    consisted of thousands of tiny marks obsessively repeated across large canvases without
                    regard for the edges of the canvas, as if they continued into infinity.

                <h2 class="titulo">Takashi Murakami</h2>
                <p>Drawing from traditional Japanese painting, sci-fi, anime, and the global art market, Takashi
                    Murakami creates paintings, sculptures, and films populated by repeated motifs and mutating
                    characters of his own creation. His wide-ranging work embodies an intersection of pop
                    culture, history, and fine art.
                    Murakami earned a BA, MFA, and PhD from Tokyo University of the Arts, where he studied
                    nihonga (traditional Japanese painting). In 1996 he established the Hiropon Factory, a
                    studio/workshop that in subsequent years grew into an art production and artist management
                    company, now known as Kaikai Kiki Co. Ltd.
                    Since the early 1990s Murakami has invented characters that combine aspects of popular
                    cartoons from Japan, Europe, and the US—from his first Mr. DOB, who sometimes serves as
                    a stand-in for the artist himself, to various anime characters and smiling flowers, bears, and
                    lions. These figures act as icons and symbols—hosts for more complex themes of violence,
                    technology, and fantasy.

                <p>Hiroshi Sugimoto is a renowned Japanese photographer born in Tokyo in 1948. He
                    began his studies in politics and sociology at Saint Paul University (Tokyo), but in 1970
                    he moved to Los Angeles to study photography at the Art Center College of Design. He
                    currently lives between New York and Tokyo.
                    Influenced by the technique and aesthetics of Dadaism and Surrealism, Sugimoto has
                    created several series of works that deal with the animate and inanimate, the real and
                    the unreal, the past and the present, the concrete and the abstract, the visible and the
                    invisible. His works are characterized by their visual beauty, use of natural light,
                    shadows and purity of form and mastery of technique, rejecting digital technology in
                    favor of traditional methods. To elaborate his exquisite black and white images he
                    works with a large format camera.

                <h2 class="titulo"> Utagawa Kuniyoshi</h2>
                <p>In the last years of the Edo period in Japan, the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, like all the
                    masters of Ukiyo-e, revolutionized not only Japanese art, but all world art when his
                    very fresh proposals reached the eyes of French artists in the mid-nineteenth century on
                    the occasion of the universal exhibitions. The Japanese engravings of masters such as
                    Kuniyoshi can be considered the seed of modern art.
                    Kuniyoshi was the son of a silk dyer. He helped his father in the business and this must
                    have influenced his textile designs and the use of color in his prints. At the age of twelve
                    he was already an attraction because of his good drawing skills and became an
                    apprentice in the workshop of Utagawa Toyokuni.
                    When he became independent, he began to create parodies and drawings of warriors
                    and actors, as was the fashion. Also bijinga women (the pin-ups of the time). But he also
                    discovered the importance of the effects of light and shadow of Western art, which he
                    imitated in the oriental way. Of course, his style was based on textile patterns.
