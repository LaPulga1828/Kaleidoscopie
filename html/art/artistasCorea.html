                <h2 class="titulo">Kim Hong-do</h2>
                <p>Kim Hong-do was born in 1745, the 21st year of King Yeongjo’s reign, and died in 1806,
                    the sixth year of King Sunjo’s. His lifetime of 62 years was a time of serenity and
                    economic abundance. Unaffected by any war, the period is often described as the
                    renaissance of the latter half of Joseon. Such peace and affluence were attributable to
                    two kings who made genuine efforts to care for their people: Yeongjo, the 21st king of
                    the dynasty who reigned for 52 years from 1724 to 1776 and Jeongjo, the next king who
                    ruled for 24 years from 1776 to 1800. Not surprisingly, his paintings are full of optimism
                    and pride for Joseon culture. One should not overlook this historical background to
                    truly understand Kim and his works.
                    Kim Hong-do was a court painter. The position was equivalent to a low-ranking
                    government official of today. Neo-Confucianism was the governing principle of Joseon
                    at the time and art was not of primary importance (albeit often considered as necessary)
                    for high-class yangban (male Confucian scholars).

                <p>Shin Saimdang was a Korean artist, writer, calligraphist, and poet. She was born in
                    Gangwondo Gangneung-bu Jukheon-li Bukpyeong-chon. Her birth home, Ojukheon,
                    which is also her mother's side home, is well-preserved to this day. She was the
                    mother of the Korean Confucian scholar Yi I. Often held up as a model of Confucian
                    ideals, her respectful nickname was Eojin Eomeoni. Her real name was Shin In-seon.
                    Her pen names were Saim, Saimdang, Inimdang, and Imsajae. She was a
                    contemporary of the poet Heo Nansseolheon, and the two women were considered
                    rivals.

                <p>Jeong Seon was a Korean landscape painter, also known by the pen name Kyomjae.
                    His cha was Wonbaek and another ho was Nangok. His works include ink and oriental water
                    paintings, as well as numerous "true-view" landscape paintings on the subject of Korea and
                    the history of its culture. He is counted among the most famous Korean painters.
                    The landscape paintings that he produced reflect most of the geographical features of Korea.
                    His style is realistic rather than abstract.

                <p>Born and raised in Korea under Japanese rule, Lee was born into an affluent family in
                    Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province in present-day North Korea. His family owned
                    an extensive area of land, and Lee's brother, who was twelve years older than him, ran the
                    biggest department store at the time in Wonsan. Lee's brother assumed a paternal role after
                    their father's death in 1918. Lee attended Jongno Primary School in Pyongyang, and found
                    his artistic calling when he encountered replicas of Goguryeo tomb murals at the Pyongyang
                    Prefectural Museum near the elementary school. The grand scale and vivid wall paintings
